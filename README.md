### General Description

The main idea for this project is to play chess with made out pieces. If the player can think of it and it's within the game combinations of abilities (so it's not that broken) then it's playable.
The main problem while developing this is that some features for different pieces (like giant pieces or switchable ones) are very complex to implement.
The logic for some of them pieces might need reworking some files.
